# Devcontainers Features

## Background

This repository is based on `https://github.com/devcontainers-extra/features`.  It defines features for a variety of tools.

## Docs

The Github release workflow is broken and not creating documentation.  This can be done manually be running `npx -y -p @devcontainers/cli@latest devcontainer features generate-docs -n aps831/devcontainers-features` from with the `src` directory.

## Test

Before any tests, ensure that the latest base devcontainers image is pulled: `docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/base:debian`.

To test an individual feature use:

```bash
npx -y -p @devcontainers/cli@latest devcontainer features test -f <feature_name> --skip-autogenerated
```

## Pending

Tests for the maven and poetry features have been moved to `pending` until dependsOn is implemented.
